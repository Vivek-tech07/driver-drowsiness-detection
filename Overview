This project is a Python-based application designed to improve road safety by detecting driver drowsiness in real-time using a webcam. It leverages computer vision and machine learning to monitor facial features and eye states, triggering an audible alarm if signs of drowsiness are detected.

The system is robust, operating effectively in varied environmental conditions, and aims to reduce road accidents caused by driver fatigue.
